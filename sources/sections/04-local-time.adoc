== Local Time

=== Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

Because the daylight saving rules for local time zones are so
convoluted and can change based on local law at unpredictable times,
true interoperability is best achieved by using Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC). This specification does not cater to local time zone rules.

=== Local Offsets

The offset between local time and UTC is often useful information.
For example, in electronic mail (<<RFC2822>>) the local
offset provides a useful heuristic to determine the probability of a
prompt response. Attempts to label local offsets with alphabetic
strings have resulted in poor interoperability in the past <<RFC1123>>.
As a result, <<RFC2822>> has made numeric offsets mandatory.

Numeric offsets are calculated as "local time minus UTC".  So the
equivalent time in UTC can be determined by subtracting the offset
from the local time. For example, `18:50:00-04:00` is the same time as
`22:50:00Z`. (This example shows negative offsets handled by adding
the absolute value of the offset.)

// NOTE: Following ISO 8601, numeric offsets represent only time
// zones that differ from UTC by an integral number of minutes.
// However, many historical time zones differ from UTC by a non-
// integral number of minutes. To represent such historical time
// stamps exactly, applications must convert them to a representable
// time zone.

Numeric offsets may differ from UTC by any number of seconds, or even a
fraction of seconds. This can be easily represented by including an
optional seconds value in the offset, which may further optionally include
a fraction of seconds behind a decimal point, for example `+12:34:56.789`.
This is especially useful in the case of certain historical time zones.

=== Unknown Local Offset Convention

If the time in UTC is known, but the offset to local time is unknown,
this can be represented with an offset of "-00:00". This differs
semantically from an offset of "Z" or "+00:00", which imply that UTC
is the preferred reference point for the specified time. RFC2822
<<RFC2822>> describes a similar convention for email.

=== Unqualified Local Time

A number of devices currently connected to the Internet run their
internal clocks in local time and are unaware of UTC. While the
Internet does have a tradition of accepting reality when creating
specifications, this should not be done at the expense of
interoperability. Since interpretation of an unqualified local time
zone will fail in approximately 23/24 of the globe, the
interoperability problems of unqualified local time are deemed
unacceptable for the Internet. Systems that are configured with a
local time, are unaware of the corresponding UTC offset, and depend
on time synchronization with other Internet systems, MUST use a
mechanism that ensures correct synchronization with UTC. Some
suitable mechanisms are:

* Use Network Time Protocol <<RFC1305>> to obtain the time in UTC.
* Use another host in the same local time zone as a gateway to the
Internet. This host MUST correct unqualified local times that are
transmitted to other hosts.
* Prompt the user for the local time zone and daylight saving rule
settings.
