== Date and Time format

This section discusses desirable qualities of date and time formats
 and defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in Internet protocols.

=== Ordering

If date and time components are ordered from least precise to most
precise, then a useful property is achieved. Assuming that the time
zones of the dates and times are the same (e.g., all in UTC),
expressed using the same string (e.g., all "Z" or all "+00:00"), and all
times have the same number of fractional second digits then the date and
time strings may be sorted as strings (e.g., using the `strcmp()` function
in C) and a time-ordered sequence will result. The presence of optional
punctuation would violate this characteristic.

=== Human Readability

Human readability has proved to be a valuable feature of Internet
protocols. Human readable protocols greatly reduce the costs of
debugging since telnet often suffices as a test client and network
analyzers need not be modified with knowledge of the protocol. On
the other hand, human readability sometimes results in
interoperability problems. For example, the date format "10/11/1996"
is completely unsuitable for global interchange because it is
interpreted differently in different countries. In addition, the
date format in (RFC822) has resulted in interoperability problems when
people assumed any text string was permitted and translated the three
letter abbreviations to other languages or substituted date formats
which were easier to generate (e.g. the format used by the C function
`ctime`). For this reason, a balance must be struck between human
readability and interoperability.

Because no date and time format is readable according to the
conventions of all countries, Internet clients SHOULD be prepared to
transform dates into a display format suitable for the locality.
This may include translating UTC to local time.

=== Rarely Used Options

A format which includes rarely used options is likely to cause
interoperability problems. This is because rarely used options are
less likely to be used in alpha or beta testing, so bugs in parsing
are less likely to be discovered. Rarely used options should be made
mandatory or omitted for the sake of interoperability whenever
possible.

// The format defined below includes only one rarely used option:
// fractions of a second. It is expected that this will be used only by
// applications which require strict ordering of date/time stamps or
// which have an unusual precision requirement.

// NOTE: does this apply any longer?

=== Redundant Information

If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
date is correct, or vice versa. Since it is not difficult to compute
the day of week from a date (see <<annexA>>), the day of week should
not be included in a date/time format.

=== Simplicity

// <<annexA>> contains an attempt to translate the complete syntax of ISO
// 8601 into <<RFC2234>>.

The complete set of date and time formats specified in ISO 8601
<<ISO8601>> is quite complex in an attempt to provide multiple
representations and partial representations. Internet protocols have
somewhat different requirements and simplicity has proved to be an
important characteristic. In addition, Internet protocols usually need
complete specification of data in order to achieve true interoperability.
Therefore, the complete grammar for ISO 8601 is deemed too complex for
most Internet protocols.

The following section defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use on the
Internet. It is a conformant subset of the ISO 8601 extended format with
additional information optionally suffixed. Simplicity is achieved by
making most fields and punctuation mandatory.

=== Internet Date/Time Format

The following profile of <<ISO8601>> dates SHOULD be used in new protocols
on the Internet. This is specified using the syntax description notation
defined in <<RFC2234>>.

[[grammar]]
[source]
----
date-year      = 4DIGIT / ("+" / "-") 6DIGIT
date-month     = 2DIGIT ; 01-12
date-mday      = 2DIGIT ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on month/year
date-full      = date-year "-" date-month "-" date-mday

time-hour      = 2DIGIT ; 00-23
time-minute    = 2DIGIT ; 00-59
time-second    = 2DIGIT ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second rules
time-secfrac   = "." 1*DIGIT
time-partial   = time-hour ":" time-minute ":" time-second [time-secfrac]
time-numoffset = ("+" / "-") time-partial
time-offset    = "Z" / time-numoffset
time-full      = time-partial time-offset

date-time      = date-full "T" time-full
----

NOTE: Per <<RFC2234>> and ISO8601, the "T" and "Z" characters in this
syntax may alternatively be lower case "t" or "z" respectively.

This date/time format may be used in some environments or contexts
that distinguish between the upper- and lower-case letters 'A'-'Z'
and 'a'-'z' (e.g. XML). Specifications that use this format in
such environments MAY further limit the date/time syntax so that
the letters 'T' and 'Z' used in the date/time syntax must always
be upper case. Applications that generate this format SHOULD use
upper case letters.

NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by "T".
Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of
readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by
(say) a space character.

[[restrictions]]
=== Restrictions

The grammar element date-mday represents the day number within the
current month. The maximum value varies based on the month and year
as follows:

.Days in each month
|===
| Month Number  | Month/Year           | Maximum value of date-mday

| 01            | January              | 31
| 02            | February, normal     | 28
| 02            | February, leap year  | 29
| 03            | March                | 31
| 04            | April                | 30
| 05            | May                  | 31
| 06            | June                 | 30
| 07            | July                 | 31
| 08            | August               | 31
| 09            | September            | 30
| 10            | October              | 31
| 11            | November             | 30
| 12            | December             | 31
|===

<<annexB>> contains sample C code to determine if a year is a leap
year.

The grammar element time-second may have the value "60" at the end of
months in which a leap second occurs -- to date: June (XXXX-06-
30T23:59:60Z) or December (XXXX-12-31T23:59:60Z); see <<annexC>> for
a table of leap seconds. It is also possible for a leap second to be
subtracted, at which times the maximum value of time-second is "58".
At all other times the maximum value of time-second is "59".
Further, in time zones other than "Z", the leap second point is
shifted by the zone offset (so it happens at the same instant around
the globe).

Leap seconds cannot be predicted far into the future. The
International Earth Rotation Service publishes bulletins <<IERS>> that
announce leap seconds with a few weeks' warning. Applications should
not generate timestamps involving inserted leap seconds until after
the leap seconds are announced.

Although ISO 8601 permits the hour to be "24", this profile of ISO 8601
only allows values between "00" and "23" for the hour in order to reduce
confusion.

[[date-time-examples]]
=== Examples

Here are some examples of Internet date/time format.

[%unnumbered]
----
1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z
----

This represents 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after the 23rd hour of
April 12th, 1985 in UTC.

[%unnumbered]
----
+001985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z
----

This represents the same instant as the previous example but with the
expanded 6-digit year format.

[%unnumbered]
----
1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
----

This represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of
December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC (Pacific
Standard Time). Note that this is equivalent to 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z
in UTC.

[%unnumbered]
----
1990-12-31T23:59:60Z
----

This represents the leap second inserted at the end of 1990.

[%unnumbered]
----
1990-12-31T15:59:60-08:00
----

This represents the same leap second in Pacific Standard Time, 8
hours behind UTC.

[%unnumbered]
----
1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:19:32.130
----

This represents the same instant of time as noon, January 1, 1937,
Netherlands time. Standard time in the Netherlands was exactly 19
minutes and 32.13 seconds ahead of UTC by law from 1909-05-01 through
1937-06-30.
