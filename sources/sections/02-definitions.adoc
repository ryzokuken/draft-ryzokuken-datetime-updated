== Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119>>.

UTC:: Coordinated Universal Time as maintained since 1988 by the Bureau
International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in conjunction with
leap seconds as announced by the International Earth Rotation
and Reference Frames Service <<IERS>>. From 1972 through 1987
UTC was maintained entirely by Bureau International de l'Heure (BIH).
Before 1972 UTC was not generally recognized and
civil time was determined by individual jurisdictions
using different techniques for attempting to follow
Universal Time based on measuring the rotation of the earth.

second:: The unit of time in the
International System of Units. Since Resolution 1 of the 13th
CGPM on 1967-10-13 <<CGPM>> the second is defined as the
duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave radiation
absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of
cesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by
external fields, but this definition was not in practical
use for civil time until 1972-01-01. Prior to 1972-01-01
civil time was based on Universal Time which was measured by observations of the rotation
of the earth, and the practical definition of the second
was 1/86400 of the mean solar day.

minute:: A period of time of 60 seconds. However, see also the
restrictions in section <<restrictions>> and <<annexC>> for how
leap seconds are denoted within minutes.

hour:: A period of time of 60 minutes.

day:: Starting 1972-01-01 a duration of 86400 SI seconds for the UTC time scale.
In other contexts the duration of one mean solar day as agreed internationally by
the 1884 International Meridian Conference and measured using Universal Time.

leap year:: In the proleptic Gregorian calendar, a year which has
366 days. A leap year is a year whose number is divisible by
four an integral number of times, except that if it is
a centennial year (i.e. divisible by one hundred) it
shall also be divisible by four hundred an integral
number of times.

ABNF:: Augmented Backus-Naur Form, a format used to represent
permissible strings in a protocol or language, as
defined in <<RFC2234>>.

Email Date/Time Format::
The date/time format used by Internet Mail as defined
by <<RFC2822>>.

Internet Date/Time Format::
The date/time format defined in section 5 of this document.

Timestamp:: This term is used in this document to refer to an
unambiguous representation of some instant in time.

Z:: A suffix which, when applied to a time, denotes a UTC
offset of 00:00; often spoken "Zulu" from the ICAO
phonetic alphabet representation of the letter "Z".

For more information about time scales, see Appendix E of <<RFC1305>>,
Section 3 of <<ISO8601>>, and the appropriate ITU documents <<ITU-R-TF>>.
